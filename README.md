# ACNH Pocket Companion

This is a PWA made with Ionic that aims to be a companion app to Animal Crossing New Horizon for Nintendo Switch.

It is a hobby project, made to learn a few technologies while developing it. Its stack consists of:

* JS Framework: Angular 8
* CSS Framework: Ionic 5
* State Management: NgRx
* Database: DexieJS

## Local Development

### Web

To develop locally for the web, you can just run `npm start` and open `localhost:4200` in a browser.
To build for production, just run `ng build --prod`.

### Android

This app is not published for Android as of now, but it has been setup for that. Just run `npm run build-android` and the Android Studio project will be built, and can be opened there. Then, you can run on a device or an emulator.
